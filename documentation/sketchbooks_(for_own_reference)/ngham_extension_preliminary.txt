Activated by setting bit 5 in the NGHam header.
The first and second payload byte should be a type byte and a length byte.
Multple types of data can be fitted inside a NGHam packet, by starting with a new type and length byte after the previous data.

Extension data types:
0x00 Binary data of unknown type
0x01 Ham address - everything after an adress belongs to the transmitting station
0x02 Statistics
0x03 Statistics for timing reference
0x04 Position
0x05 Voice
0x06 JPEG image
0x07 Repeated ham adress (originates from another station)

** Address **
Size is 6-17 B - eg. LA3JPA to broadcast will be 8B, LA1K to broadcast is 6B, LA1K123Y to LA1K100Y is 16B
 * 2-7B mycall: 4 bit LEN (1-8), 4 bit SSID, LEN x 6 bit (chars), fill to n*8 - LA3JPA-3
 * 1B sequence number
 * 1B fields, packet type:
     1b destcall_en - if this is not a broadcast packet, insert destination callsign
     1b hopping_field_en
     1b timeslot_field_en
     1b connected_field_en
 * 1-7B destcall: 4 bit LEN (1-8), 4 bit SSID, LEN x 6 bit (chars), fill to n*8 - LA3JPA-3
 * 1B hopping: 2b reserved, 1b fill_in_hop_finished, 1b fill_in_hop_total, 2b hops_finished, 2b hops_total (not including fill-in)
 * 2B timeslot information
 * 1B connected mode information: 0=cts, 1=rts, 2=ack, 3=nack

** Position **
If address is enabled, use broadcast. Address size will therefore be 11 B.
Wait one full timeslot period to generate adress book, then picks random free timeslot
A collision packet (TBD) is transmitted to make station move to another timeslot. If no other option, stay on the same timeslot.
A timeslot is considered free again if not used for 3 periods.
 * 4 B latitude
 * 4 B longitude
 * 3 B altitude
 * 3 B speed and heading: 14b speed, 10b heading

** Voice **
 * 42B voice (7x6B 2400bps Codec2 frames, 140 ms of voice)
Takes less than 140 ms to transmit at 4800 baud. Will fit in 60 B payload size with 1 B to 12 B padding.

( * 2B timeslot information: 12b first timeslot, 4 b timeslot modulo (transmits every 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024) )
